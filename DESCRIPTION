Description: Monte Carlo-Wilcoxon (MCW) tests assess the significance of
    the difference between two sets of quantitative data by calculating
    sums of ranks (Wilcoxon) for the dataset under examination before and
    after rearranging it multiple times (Monte Carlo). This package offers the
    ability to execute four different MCW tests, each with unique data
    structures and specific questions to address.
