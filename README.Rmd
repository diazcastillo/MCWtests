# MCWtests

Monte Carlo-Wilcoxon (MCW) tests assess the significance of the difference between two sets of quantitative data by computing the sums of ranks (Wilcoxon) for the dataset under examination before and after repeatedly rearranging it (Monte Carlo). This package offers the ability to execute four different MCW tests, each with unique data structures and specific questions to address.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MCWtests from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("diazcastillo/MCWtests")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MCWtests)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
